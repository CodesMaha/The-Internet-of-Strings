I'm forced to bear with them. \n\nI'm even forced to work on a website dedicated to them, whose URL is blueberries.gov, literally named after them!\nThe site itself makes absolutely no sense. I mean, why am I forced to code two different pages of the site? Why are there two distinct passwords, {password_a} and {password_b}?\n\nBlueberries are, like, the bane of my existence. \nLife is like a blueberry to me...'''
