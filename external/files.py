Still, I have to eat them. I'm forced to bear with them. 

I'm even forced to work on a website dedicated to them, whose URL is blueberries.gov, literally named after them!
The site itself makes absolutely no sense. I mean, why am I forced to code two different pages of the site? Why are there two distinct passwords, {password_a} and {password_b}?

Blueberries are, like, the bane of my existence. 

Well, now that I've worked on the site, I have more context with that. But, out of all items to "protect", they picked blueberries! It's as if blueberries, my nightmare, refuse to stop haunting me.

Life is like a blueberry to me...'''
